# Citizen AI ‚Äì Intelligent Citizen Engagement Platform  

## üìå Introduction  
Citizen AI is a platform built using **IBM Granite models** to provide quick and helpful answers about government services, civic issues, and city safety analysis. It also includes features for **citizen interaction, public sentiment tracking, and dashboard visualization** to support government transparency and engagement.  

The system runs efficiently on **Google Colab with GPU support**, making it lightweight, cost-effective, and easy to deploy.

## üöÄ Features  
- **Conversational Assistance** ‚Äì Provides natural language responses to citizen queries.  
- **City Analysis** ‚Äì Generates reports on crime index, accidents, and overall safety of cities.  
- **Sentiment Tracking** ‚Äì Analyzes citizen feedback for government officials.  
- **Dashboard Visualization** ‚Äì Displays insights in a simple and transparent way.  
- **Lightweight Deployment** ‚Äì Runs seamlessly in Google Colab.
